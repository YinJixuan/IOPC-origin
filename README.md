# IOPC
This repository contains the code for the paper _IOPC: Enhancing Alignment Between Semantic and Cluster Centers for Few-shot Short Text Clustering_, submitted to ACL2025.

If you want to run this code, first download the M3 model from https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5/tree/main . You need to download 4 files: (1) config.json ,(2) pytorch_model.bin
 ,(3) tokenizer.json ,(4) vocab.txt . Then put them into a folder named "pretrain-model-M3" in the project folder, and run run_all.py to reproduce our experiments.
